# Woolworths Village Wallet SDK Open API Client

As detailed in the [Woolworths Village Android SDK](https://github.com/woolworthslimited/paysdk2-android),
access to the APIs is facaded through an interface to allow different
implementations to be used according to applications needs and
technology choices.

#### Open API implementation

The SDK can be used with an implementation of the `VillageApiRepository`
that uses the [Open API generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/) to
provide an API Client with DTOs representing the data structures of the
API. The SDK can be configured to use different libraries that the Open
API generator supports to again make it easier to embed into an existing
project with existing technology choices.

The use of an Open API implementation is a compile time choice as the
relevant libraries will all need to be included. It is not recommended to
try to use multiple implementations in the one build/app.

The current Open API implementations are:
 - `okhttp-gson` - Uses the [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)
     framework with [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) for JSON
     (de)serialisation.
 - `objc` - Generates a SDK for use in an XCode project.

Each implementation's README contains more details on how to use the
API client, however the implementations follow a naming pattern so
that it's easy to swap variants if required.

The `objc` implementation should be integrated into the [correct location](https://github.com/woolworthslimited/paysdk2-openapi-ios)
so that the framework is publishable/consumable via Cocoa Pods.

#### Versioning

The code generated by the Open API generator should match a version of
the API spec that is supported by the SDK framework. This framework
should match the major version of the SDK framework, and the minor
version where appropriate. However patch versions may differ according
to need.

#### Generating an Open API implementation

If the implementation needs to be updated the relevant "SDK API Generators"
task can be used; see `$ ./gradlew tasks` for details.

**Caveat:** Due to not being able to [provide the API spec dynamically](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/5965),
the Village API spec is expected to be found in the root of the project.

A symlink will suffice.

#### Building an Open API implementation with Gradle

The project takes advantage of Gradle [Multi Project Builds](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html)
to allow configuration and execution of the tasks to build/test/publish
an Open API implementation.

As such, the top level tasks of `build`, `test`, etc will run these tasks
**for all** Open API implementation. To run (address) a specific implementation, use the
path to the project (see [Gradle docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html#sec:running_partial_build_from_the_root)
for more details).

For example, to build only the API client using "OkHTTP with GSON" run

```sh
$ ./gradlew :okhttp-gson:build
```

#### Testing an Open API implementation

For each Open API implementation we want to create a "virtual test project", that
mixes the source of the library, the Android tools, and the tests
for the API. By organising by a "virtual project" we can keep
classpaths separate and compiled code from mixing between Open API implementations.
In stock Gradle this could be achieved through `sourceSets`,
`configurations` and `dependencies` configuration.

However we can't [mix](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49714744/failed-to-resolve-project-android-library-and-java-library-module-dependency)
Android [modules](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/dependency_management_terminology.html#sub:terminology_module)
(projects) into Java modules (projects), which prevents us from allowing
each Open API implementation the ability to manage it's build/test lifecycle with
the Android libraries and the API tests being mixed into the implementation
project (to help with isolation).

Unfortunately the Android Gradle Plugin doesn't not allow arbitrary
`sourceSets`, etc to be configured by the root project as it provides
it's own `sourceSet` implementation in order to implement features
(like flavour variants). Consequently we utilise the [Product Flavour](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants#product-flavors)
facility to dynamically create a product flavour per Open API implementation to
then allow the isolated testing of each API implementation. This means that
unit tests are run in isolation, and if Android Instrumentation Tests
want to be run, a separate APK per Open API implementation will be produced; again
for isolation.

#### Dependency details

Each flavour variant gets its own dependency tree and classpath. To help
see what dependencies are being used a project report is available.

```sh
$ ./gradlew projectReport 
```

#### Testing setup

The API tests make HTTP requests to a stub server to validate endpoint
IO. The tests are concerned about data structures only. The API client doesn't
care that an ID is a guid or not, it cares that a string is sent or received.

Therefore the tests are not reliant on particular data values.

Any server can be used for the API tests, however a default `api-stubs`
is available. It uses a [Docker Imposter](https://github.com/outofcoffee/imposter)
to return data provided by `examples` in the API spec. Therefore the
`examples` should be kept up to date.

A [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file is provided to
run the stubs on `http://localhost:8080`

**Caveat**: If using Docker, a symlink to the spec won't work because
Docker wont be able to resolve the destination of the link from inside
the container. The file has to be present in the `api-stubs` dir

```shell
$ cd api-stubs
$ cp `readlink ../village.json` .
$ docker-compose up --force-recreate
```

#### Running tests

The API tests need to be run against an Open API implementation, and the [Gradle
build](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/command-line) is setup
to do that. To run the tests for a particular variant run the right
task ie: `test[API Implementation]DebugUnitTest` which follows the Android SDK API
task naming conventions.

To run a specific test, use the `--test` [feature](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html#test_filtering)
of Gradle to specify the FQN of the test you want to run.

##### Using Android Studio (IDE)

In order to run tests in an IDE ie: Android Studio, the default
`Android JUnit` [Run Configuration](https://developer.android.com/studio/test#run_a_test)
can't be used as the IDE will not be able to configure the classpath
correctly and the Open API implementation source will not be found. The project
will either fail to compile or throw a `ClassNotFoundException` at runtime.

The IDE `Gradle` [Run Configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/create-run-debug-configuration-gradle-tasks.html)
should be used with the `--tests` option in the `Arguments`. This will run
the task allowing the test to be run in the IDE.

#### Publishing a Open API implementation version

- TODO: Publishing

#### Adding a new Open API implementation

1. Add the Open API generator details to the root `apis` dictionary. A
new task will be added to the "SDK API Generators" task group.
2. Run the generation task
3. For Java/Gradle projects, add the project to the `settings.gradle`
so that the top level build can "load" the project
4. Run tasks to build, test, etc
5. Commit the new Open API implementation.
